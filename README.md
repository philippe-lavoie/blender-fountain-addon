# Fountain script add-on

## About

This add-on allows Blender to use [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) to describe the storyboard or screenplay if you prefer.

## Features

This add-on allows you to:
- Import a fountain script
    - This adds markers to elements inside the script like
        - Section headers
        - Scene headers
        - Transitions
        - Dialogue
        - Actions
- View the fountain elements on the View3D
    - Click on 'Show Scene Information' to enable this
- Click on a fountain marker to 
    - quickly jump in the timeline
    - move the cursor to the appropriate line in the script
- Clear all markers
- Update the fountain script
    - This adds notes that identify the frame and duration of each element.
- Clean Script
    - This removes the notes to have a cleaner version of the script. Useful when exporting the text.
- Print markers
    - prints the time and the marker's content. Useful for youtube (I guess)
- Sync markers
    - after you move the markers around make sure that
    fountain is aware of the changes.

## Usage

+ In the text editor, open or write a fountain script.
+ In the fountain add-on, select the script
